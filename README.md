# File Reader and Modifier (Python Script
Overview
This Python script allows you to:
- Read the contents of a text file.
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., file not found, permission issues).
- Convert the content to **uppercase**.
- Save the modified version into a **new file** prefixed with `modified_`.

This is a beginner-friendly project demonstrating **file handling, error handling, and string manipulation** in Python.

---

## üöÄ How It Works
1. The program asks you to **enter a filename**.
2. It attempts to open and read the file:
   - If the file is missing or inaccessible, an error message is displayed.
3. The content is **converted to uppercase**.
4. A new file named `modified_<original_filename>` is created.
5. The modified content is saved in this new file.

---

 Example Usage
```bash
$ python file_modifier.py
Enter the file name to read: notes.txt
 Modified file has been saved as 'modified_notes.txt'
If the file doesn‚Äôt exist:

bash
Copy
Edit
$ python file_modifier.py
Enter the file name to read: missing.txt
 Error: The file does not exist.
 File Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
project-folder/
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ file_modifier.py   # The main script
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.txt          # Example input file (optional)
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ modified_notes.txt # Output after running the script
‚ö° Features
Error handling for:

Missing file (FileNotFoundError)

Permission issues (PermissionError)

Other unexpected errors

Easy-to-understand and extendable code.

Creates a safe copy instead of overwriting the original file.

üîß Requirements
Python 3.6+

No external libraries are required.

üõ†Ô∏è Possible Improvements
Add more content modifications (e.g., lowercase, word count, replace words).

Allow saving to a custom output filename.

Add a menu for multiple text transformations.
